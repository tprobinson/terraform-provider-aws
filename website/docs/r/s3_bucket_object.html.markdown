# aws_s3_bucket_object

Provides a S3 bucket object resource.

## Example Usage

### Uploading a file to a bucket

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket_object" "object" {
  bucket = "your_bucket_name"
  key    = "new_object_key"
  source = "path/to/file"
  etag   = "${md5(file("path/to/file"))}"
}
```

### Encrypting with KMS Key

```hcl
resource "aws_kms_key" "examplekms" {
  description             = "KMS key 1"
  deletion_window_in_days = 7
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "examplebucket" {
  bucket = "examplebuckettftest"
  acl    = "private"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_object" "examplebucket_object" {
  key        = "someobject"
  bucket     = "${aws_s3_bucket.examplebucket.id}"
  source     = "index.html"
  kms_key_id = "${aws_kms_key.examplekms.arn}"
}
```

### Server Side Encryption with S3 Default Master Key

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "examplebucket" {
  bucket = "examplebuckettftest"
  acl    = "private"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_object" "examplebucket_object" {
  key                    = "someobject"
  bucket                 = "${aws_s3_bucket.examplebucket.id}"
  source                 = "index.html"
  server_side_encryption = "aws:kms"
}
```

## Argument Reference

-> **Note:** If you specify `content_encoding` you are responsible for encoding the body appropriately. `source`, `content`, and `content_base64` all expect already encoded/compressed bytes.

The following arguments are supported:

* `bucket` - (Required) The name of the bucket to put the file in.
* `key` - (Required) The name of the object once it is in the bucket.
* `source` - (Required unless `content` or `content_base64` is set) The path to a file that will be read and uploaded as raw bytes for the object content.
* `content` - (Required unless `source` or `content_base64` is set) Literal string value to use as the object content, which will be uploaded as UTF-8-encoded text.
* `content_base64` - (Required unless `source` or `content` is set) Base64-encoded data that will be decoded and uploaded as raw bytes for the object content. This allows safely uploading non-UTF8 binary data, but is recommended only for small content such as the result of the `gzipbase64` function with small text strings. For larger objects, use `source` to stream the content from a disk file.
* `acl` - (Optional) The [canned ACL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#canned-acl) to apply. Defaults to "private".
* `cache_control` - (Optional) Specifies caching behavior along the request/reply chain Read [w3c cache_control](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.9) for further details.
* `content_disposition` - (Optional) Specifies presentational information for the object. Read [w3c content_disposition](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec19.html#sec19.5.1) for further information.
* `content_encoding` - (Optional) Specifies what content encodings have been applied to the object and thus what decoding mechanisms must be applied to obtain the media-type referenced by the Content-Type header field. Read [w3c content encoding](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.11) for further information.
* `content_language` - (Optional) The language the content is in e.g. en-US or en-GB.
* `content_type` - (Optional) A standard MIME type describing the format of the object data, e.g. application/octet-stream. All Valid MIME Types are valid for this input.
* `website_redirect` - (Optional) Specifies a target URL for [website redirect](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/how-to-page-redirect.html).
* `storage_class` - (Optional) Specifies the desired [Storage Class](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html)
for the object. Can be either "`STANDARD`", "`REDUCED_REDUNDANCY`", "`ONEZONE_IA`", or "`STANDARD_IA`". Defaults to "`STANDARD`".
* `etag` - (Optional) Used to trigger updates. The only meaningful value is `${md5(file("path/to/file"))}`.
This attribute is not compatible with `kms_key_id`.
* `server_side_encryption` - (Optional) Specifies server-side encryption of the object in S3. Valid values are "`AES256`" and "`aws:kms`".
* `kms_key_id` - (Optional) Specifies the AWS KMS Key ARN to use for object encryption.
This value is a fully qualified **ARN** of the KMS Key. If using `aws_kms_key`,
use the exported `arn` attribute:
      `kms_key_id = "${aws_kms_key.foo.arn}"`
* `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags to assign to the object.

Either `source` or `content` must be provided to specify the bucket content.
These two arguments are mutually-exclusive.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported

* `id` - the `key` of the resource supplied above
* `etag` - the ETag generated for the object (an MD5 sum of the object content).
* `version_id` - A unique version ID value for the object, if bucket versioning
is enabled.
