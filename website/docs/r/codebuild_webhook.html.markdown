# aws_codebuild_webhook

Provides a CodeBuild Webhook resource.

## Example Usage

### GitHub

~> **Note:** For GitHub source projects, the AWS account that Terraform uses to create this resource *must* have authorized CodeBuild to access GitHub's OAuth API in each applicable region. This is a manual step that must be done *before* creating webhooks with this resource. If OAuth is not configured, AWS will return an error similar to `ResourceNotFoundException: Could not find access token for server type github`. More information can be found in the [CodeBuild User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/sample-github-pull-request.html).

```hcl
resource "aws_codebuild_webhook" "example" {
  name = "${aws_codebuild_project.example.name}"
}
```

### GitHub Enterprise

More information creating webhooks with GitHub Enterprise can be found in the [CodeBuild User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/sample-github-enterprise.html).

```hcl
resource "aws_codebuild_webhook" "example" {
  name = "${aws_codebuild_project.example.name}"
}

resource "github_repository_webhook" "example" {
  active     = true
  events     = ["push"]
  name       = "example"
  repository = "${github_repository.example.name}"

  configuration {
    url          = "${aws_codebuild_webhook.example.payload_url}"
    secret       = "${aws_codebulld_webhook.example.secret}"
    content_type = "json"
    insecure_ssl = false
  }
}
```
